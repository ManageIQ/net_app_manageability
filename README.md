## Installation

First, install the NetApp Manageability SDK.

- This is only provided by NetApp directly.  For the next steps, we will assume these files are located in `$INSTALL_DIR`.

- Create symlinks for libssl and libcrypto, if necessary.

  ```sh
  ln -s libssl.so $INSTALL_DIR/lib/linux-64/libssl.so.0.9.8
  ln -s libcrypto.so $INSTALL_DIR/lib/linux-64/libcrypto.so.0.9.8
  ```

Next, if using bundler

- Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

  ```ruby
  gem 'net_app_manageability'
  ```

- If the NetApp Manageability SDK is not available on the normal compile paths, then execute:

  ```sh
  bundle config build.net_app_manageability --with-netapp-manageability-sdk-include=$INSTALL_DIR/include --with-netapp-manageability-sdk-lib=$INSTALL_DIR/lib/linux-64
  ```

- And finally execute:

  ```sh
  bundle
  ```

Otherwise, if not using bundler

- If the NetApp Manageability SDK is not available on the normal compile paths, then execute:

  ```sh
  gem install net_app_manageability --with-netapp-manageability-sdk-include=$INSTALL_DIR/include --with-netapp-manageability-sdk-lib=$INSTALL_DIR/lib/linux-64
  ```

- Otherwise execute:

  ```sh
  gem install net_app_manageability
  ```

## Usage

For examples of usage, see the [examples](examples).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake` to compile the gem and run the tests.  If you want to just compile the gem, use `rake compile`.  If the NetApp Manageability SDK is not accessible via the normal compile paths, you make have to pass those locations to `rake compile` as follows:

    rake compile -- --with-netapp-manageability-sdk-include=$INSTALL_DIR/include --with-netapp-manageability-sdk-lib=$INSTALL_DIR/lib/linux-64

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
